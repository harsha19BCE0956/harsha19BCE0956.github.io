## Projects

### **AgriChat - RAG System for Location-Specific Agricultural Queries**  
[Explore Project](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hvrrr/AgriChat)  
- Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for location-specific agricultural queries using Selenium for PDF scraping and GROBID for content extraction.  
- Used Hugging Face embeddings and **FAISS** for efficient vector indexing and retrieval, achieving a **90% success rate** in selecting RAG-generated answers over GPT-4o-mini responses.  
- Built an interactive user interface with **Streamlit**.

### **Medium Clone**  
[Explore Project](https://medium-clone-green-one.vercel.app/signup)  
- Designed and implemented a scalable blogging platform clone using React.js and TypeScript for the frontend, Cloudflare Workers for the backend, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for the database.
- Leveraged modern technologies like Zod for validation and data integrity.


### **Movie Search Engine**  
- Developed a movie search engine utilizing data extracted from Wikipedia, featuring a user-friendly interface created with Flask.  
- The system integrates Lucene and Faiss indexing to compare search results, allowing users to input queries and access relevant results from PyLucene and Faiss (BERT).
